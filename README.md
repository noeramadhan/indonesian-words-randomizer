# Indonesian Words Randomizer

Indonesian word randomizer using wordlist from [this repo](https://github.com/damzaky/kumpulan-kata-bahasa-indonesia-KBBI) and word definition from [Kateglo](http://kateglo.lostfocus.org/).

__Notes__:
Kateglo was used because there was no public API avaiable for [KBBI from Kemendikbud](https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/) and there was a daily search limit when I tried to scrape the official KBBI web app.

Built with: Node.js
## Usage
> node app.js [number of words]
- number of words: Integer, default: 1
